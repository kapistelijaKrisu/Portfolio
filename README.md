## Book-keeping tool for a game
Five-week (due to crashes 3.5-week) database and PHP project course
<br/> Grade received: B. Because of the 1.5 week crash issues, I was unable to give it the time it needed to learn PHP and fully understand how MVC works.
<br/> However, I am proud that I was able to learn as much as I did in that time, starting with 0 background knowledge in PHP and MVC architecture.

## Java-made paint program
Seven-week iterative programming project course
<br/> Grade received: A. UI was not the focus of the course but a completed application needs one. It was treated as such.
<br/> Proud of the backend
