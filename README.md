## book-keeping tool for a game
Five week (due to crashes 3.5 week) database and PHP project course
<br/> Grade B, not so proud of it as I was not able to give it the time it needed to learn PHP and fully understand how MVC works.
<br/> However I am proud that i was able to learn in that time as much as I did from knowing nothing about PHP and MVC architecture.

## Hello app
First project to apply some kind of architecture. Done in about a month. (Even before I got into university)
<br/> I am willing to show this for the reason of showing my initiative in learning!
<br/> Looking into code now after years pains me a little myself but it is my first child.
